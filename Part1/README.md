1. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  * prints i which i is the total number of the array. after passing discount price the i will be equal to 3.

2. What will happen at line 12 and why?

  * prints the saving amount. price[1] * (1-0.5) =  300 * (1-0.5) = 115. 

3. What will happen at line 13 and why?

  * The result will remain as 115. ??

4. What will the function return if we call discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) ? Give a brief explanation.

  * The result of this code will be 50, 100, 150, because the discount (.5) divided by each element of the array. 100/.5 = 50
  200/.5 = 100 and 300/.5 = 150.
