1. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  Answer: It should print i value which is the total number of the array. If we do not pass discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5), nothing will be executed and the code doesn't have an error. after passing discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5), the i will be equal to 3.

2. What will happen at line 12 and why?

  Answer: It will not execute anything for discountedPrice if you don't pass discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)  and the code doesn't have any error. It will prints the saving amount if we pass the  discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5). price[1] * (1-0.5) =  300 * (1-0.5) = 150. 

3. What will happen at line 13 and why?

  Answer: There will not anything will be executed if we don't pass discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5). we should pass the function discountedprice after return line to get the 150 for the finalPrice. 

4. What will the function return if we call discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) ? Give a brief explanation.

  Answer: The result of this code will be 3, 150, 150. the value of the i will be 3, the value of the discounted price is 150 and lastly the value of the finalPrice is also 150.

5. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  Answer: The code doens't execute anything because i is declared as "let" and it will cause an error. 

6. What will happen at line 12 and why?

 Answer: The discountedPrice declared with "let". The code will cause an error. 


7. What will happen at line 13 and why?

 Answer: If we call the discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) after the last {, after return, the code will not cause an error and it will print 150. The reseaon is line 12 cause a problem. 

8.  What will the function return for discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)? Give a brief explanation.

  Answer: It doesn't work and it will cause an error, because "i" declared with "let". "let" can be used inside the loop.

9. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  Answer: const doesn't work because it is constant and "i" declared as "let". const can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted. 

10. What will happen at line 12 and why?

  Answer: discountedPrice declared as "const" and "const" doesn't work because it is constant. "const" can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be executed.

11. What will happen at line 13 and why?

Answer: "const" doesn't work because it is constact. "const" can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted.

12. What will the function return for discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)? Give a brief explanation.

Answer: It will cause an error, because of the const data type and "const" can not be reassigned.

13. 
 A. student.name
 
 B. student['Grad Year']
 
 C. student.greeting()
 
 D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
 
 E. student.courseLoad[0]
  
14. Arithmetic

 A. 32 is the output, because '3' is a character. '3' will concate with 2.
 
 B. 1 is the output, '3' - 2 will be equal to 1. "-" is arithmatic operation and '3' acts as an intereger.
 
 C. 3 is the output and null is consider as 0. So, 0 + 3 = 3
 
 D. 3null is the output. '3' + null, '3' will concate with null.
 
 E. 4 is the output. In javascript true is considered as 1. Therefore the result for true + 3 is 1.
 
 F. 0 is the output. In javascript false is considered as 0 and null is also condidered as 0. Therefore, the result is 0.
 
 G. 3undefined is the output. string 3 ("3") concatanate with denfined. Therefore the result is: 3undefined.
 
 H. NaN is the output. In javascript undefined has no value and "+" is an arithmatic operation. Therefore, the result for "3" + undefined is NaN.


15. Comparison

 A. true is the output. '2' is converted to int and then compared with 1. Obviously 2 is greater than 1. Therefore, the output is ture.
 
 B. false is the output, because '2' and '12' are considered as string. 
 
 C. true is the output. '2' is converet to integer and "==" is the equality operation. Therefore, the result is true. 
 
 D. false is the output. "===" is an identity operationand. '2' and 2 have different type.
 
 E. false is the output. In javascript true is considered as 1 not 2 and also "=="is an equality operator.
 
 F. true is the output, because "===" is strict equality. true is the type of boolean and true === boolean(2) has the same type. 

16. === is strict equality and values which we are comparing must have the same type, but == is equality operator and it will get used when we are comparing two values, for instance in previous question 2 == '2' is true. As I described above, '2' converted to integer and it will compare with 2 integer. 


17. How are you? will be printed. based on one of the question in 15Q, I said true == 2 is false. so in this question line 1 it will execute false and we move on to line 3 (else if condition), because we are not comparing (2) with anything here, then How are you? will be printed.  

18. The output of my code is the odd numbers:

  21
 
  45
 
  5
 
  2

19. The callback will execute the array and then will execute the second parameter. The first parameter is the array [1,2,3] it will then go to the doSomthing function with adds +2 to each of value of the array. The resulting array will be [3,4,5]. It will then multiply the array by 2. The final result will be [6,8,10].

20. 

21. The output of the code:
	 4	
   
	 3
   
	 2
