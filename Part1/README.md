1. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  * prints i which i is the total number of the array. after passing discount price the i will be equal to 3.

2. What will happen at line 12 and why?

  * prints the saving amount. price[1] * (1-0.5) =  300 * (1-0.5) = 150. 

3. What will happen at line 13 and why?

  * The result will remain as 150. we should pass the function discountedprice after return line to get the 150 result. 

4. What will the function return if we call discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) ? Give a brief explanation.

  * The result of this code will be 50, 100, 150, because the discount (.5) divided by each element of the array. 100/.5 = 50
  200/.5 = 100 and 300/.5 = 150.

5. It will be 3


6. It doesn't work because of the let. let can be used inside the loop. 


7. It doesn't work because of the let. let can be used inside the loop.

8. It doesn't work because of the let. let can be used inside the loop.

9. const doesn't work because it is constact. cont can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted. 

10. const doesn't work because it is constact. cont can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted.

11. const doesn't work because it is constact. cont can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted.

12. There an error exists, because of the cost data type.
