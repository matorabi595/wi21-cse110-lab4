1. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  Answer: It should print i value which is the total number of the array. If we do not pass discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5), nothing will be executed and the code doesn't have an error. after passing discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5), the i will be equal to 3.

2. What will happen at line 12 and why?

  Answer: It will not execute anything for discountedPrice if you don't pass discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)  and the code doesn't have any error. It will prints the saving amount if we pass the  discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5). price[1] * (1-0.5) =  300 * (1-0.5) = 150. 

3. What will happen at line 13 and why?

  Answer: There will not anything will be executed if we don't pass discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5). we should pass the function discountedprice after return line to get the 150 for the finalPrice. 

4. What will the function return if we call discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) ? Give a brief explanation.

  Answer: The result of this code will be 3, 150, 150. the value of the i will be 3, the value of the discounted price is 150 and lastly the value of the finalPrice is also 150.

5. What will happen at line 11 and why?

  Answer: The code doens't execute anything because i is declared as "let" and it will cause an error. 

6. What will happen at line 12 and why?

 Answer: The discountedPrice declared with "let". The code will cause an error. 


7. What will happen at line 13 and why?

 Answer: If we call teh discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) after the last {, after return, the code will not cause an error and it will print 150. 

8. It doesn't work because of the let. let can be used inside the loop.

9. const doesn't work because it is constact. cont can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted. 

10. const doesn't work because it is constact. cont can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted.

11. const doesn't work because it is constact. cont can not be reassigned, so there's nothing will be terminanted.

12. There an error exists, because of the cost data type.
